# Overview

This program is a text based RPG with a simple plot. This game has a save file that allows the play to save and load their previous save. It also has an option to restart the game with default stats. The game has three areas to fight monsters in and a town where the player can rest and buy more items.

This game was written with two purposes, one to make an old game that I wrote better and two to learn Java. This game is my attempt to learn Java within two weeks.
